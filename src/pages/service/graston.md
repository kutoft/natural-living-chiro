faqs:
  - question: Why is scar tissue a problem?
    answer: Scar tissue limits range of motion due its negative impact on sensory motor firing rates and frequencies. Abnormal sensory inputs perpetuate a dysfunctional cycle of nervous system sensitization, pain and dysfunctional movement/motor output. GT offers a positive method of manual therapy that interrupts and breaks this cycle of pain and dysfunctional movement.
  - question: Will Graston affect my everyday activities?
    answer: Patients that have progressed beyond the acute stages of inflammation and repair are often encouraged to resume a pain-free level of activity and exercise with the modifications that are determined by their GT-trained health professional. GT is designed to be implemented with appropriate therapeutic exercises and activities to achieve an ideal outcome.
  - question: What kind of results does Graston Technique produce?
    answer: Historically, the Graston TechniqueÂ® has had positive outcomes in 75-90 percent of all conditions treated. It is equally effective in restoring function to acute and chronic injuries, pre- and post-surgical patients and maintaining optimal range of motion.
