title: Cupping
description: Cupping therapy helps promote blood circulation and brings fresh oxygen to the area in order to improve your body's natural healing abilities. Cupping works by placing special cups on your skin for a few minutes to create suction. Some of the many benefits include helping with pain, inflammation, blood flow, relaxation and well-being, and as a type of deep-tissue massage.

faqs:
  - question: What is Cupping?
    answer: Cupping creates a suction to pull the muscles up into the cups, releasing tight fascia and bringing blood supply to the surface of the skin, allowing the blood to recirculate and bring fresh oxygen and nutrients to the area.
  - question: Does Cupping hurt?
    answer: The cups are placed firmly on the back, or area of injury and left there four 10-15 minutes. Most people feel a tightness for a short amount of time before feeling warmth and an overall sense of relaxation. There is also another technique, sliding cups, where the cups are put on a bit more loosely and an oil is used to slide the cups.
  - question: What does Cupping help with?
    answer: The suction and negative pressure provided by the cups can loosen tight muscles, encouraging blood flow. Cupping is used to relieve back pain and neck pain, stiff muscles.
  - question: Does Cupping bruising hurt?
    answer: The circular marks the cups leave are the icon of this treatment. These marks are harmless and typically fade within 3-7 days, in some cases, the bruising may stay longer.
